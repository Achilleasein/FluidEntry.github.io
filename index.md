## Welcome to Fluid Entry

Welcome to FLuid Entry.
The fluid way to distribute the key to your traveler.

### How it works?

When a traveler comes at an unconvient time, you have to give them key or maybe you have more properties and a lot of people arrive at the same time. What can you do?
With Fluid Entry, when a traveler books your property digital keys are automaticly distributed with the highest security possible.
